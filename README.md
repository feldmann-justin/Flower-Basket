# Flower-Basket

The following is from the README provided by Brady Smith, a teammate of mine on this project, and from whom this repo was forked. My biggest contributions are in the AddFlowerCtlr/GUI, ChangeFlowerCtlr/GUI, and LogoutCtlr classes, as I was responsible for implementing the use cases associated with them.

Other contributors are Kade Walter and Dipak Subramaniam.

**NOTE:** I only take credit for the state of the aforementioned content within the "Class_Final" branch.
